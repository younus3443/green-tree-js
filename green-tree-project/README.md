## Getting Started
1. **Prerequisites:** A modern web browser. No build tooling is required.
2. **Open locally:** Double-click `home.html` (or `donation.html`).
3. **Navigate:** Use the “Donate Today” button in the header to move between the landing page and the donation form.

## Customization
- Update copy directly in the HTML.
- Swap images under `assets/` (match filenames or update paths).
- Adjust section-specific CSS inside the scoped files to keep changes isolated.
